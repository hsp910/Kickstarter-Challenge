# Kickstarter-Challenge

## Background
  A  challenge given to me to analyze Kickstarter data on what makes a successful crowdfunding campaign. Analyzed the data set based on outcomes from multiple other aspects; including aspects such as parent category, country, launch date, and funding goals to help determine correlations between these aspects and the ability for a campaign to be  succesful. Obviously these aspects and data can only explain so much of the picture and a large amount of the onus of the success on a crowdfunding campaign comes from the individual campaigns product/service being offered and the quality of the campaign.
